  * Drop the version number to match rviz2 for bloom.
  * update package.xml’s, versions, and disable rviz good
  * restore version
  * Add opengl dependency for ogre.
  * add license info and website for vendors
  * Add libxrandr dependency.

  * Fix point cloud decay
  * Disable stereo in view controller for now
  * Remove outdated error message from pointcloud display status
  * Fix switching between, rename and remove of view controller states
  Also fixes interactions with the Grid display
  I replaced the qobject_cast with a dynamic_cast since qobject_cast does not behave as specified in the docs.
  Namely the cast of a ViewController does not work.
  * Update meshes to new Ogre format
  * Create shape entity using default resources
  This is necessary since Ogre tries to find the default material 'BaseWhiteNoLighting'.
* Fix double window on macOS (`#137 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/137>`_)
  * remove vestigial files
  * suppress warning
  * style fixup includes

  * fix use of logging macros
  * suppress warnings generated by ogre
  * disable some tests which cannot run on CI currently
  * disable a warning I cannot reproduce locally, for now
* Use pluginlib to reenable displays panel and load basic plugins (`#123 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/123>`_)
  * move the source files for the move_tool plugin
  * make tool.hpp public
  * make rviz_common/render_panel.hpp public
  * make load_resource.hpp public
  * make view_manager.hpp public
  * use PIMPL pattern in view_manager
  This was done to avoid needing to make the header
  pluginlib_factory.hpp public in rviz_common.

  * fixups
  * remove references to boost
  * fix loading of default rviz configuration
  * add and use a vendor package for yaml-cpp
  * build assimp if version less than 4.0.0
  This is to make sure we have valid CMake infrastructure from assimp.
  * Fix visibility and warnings of rviz_rendering on Windows
  * fix includes
  * fixup linking and compiling for rviz_common
  * disable automoc and tests for rviz_common (temporary)
  This commit should be removed later.
  I had to do it for now to try and make progress on Windows.
  * Fix wrong rotation in OrbitViewController (`#129 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/129>`_)
  * fix build on macOS (probably Linux too)
  * disable Windows for now (with optional override)

  License question was resolved in https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/1147.
  * fix loading of “local” displays and errors on start
  * fixup typo in package.xml
  * put default plugins in their own folder
  * migrate grid display plugin to rviz_default_plugins
  * fixups
  * remove more temporary code and more fixups
* Use current Ogre3D master (ca665a6) for rviz_ogre_vendor (`#127 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/127>`_)
  * Switch to current Ogre3D master (ca665a6)
  - This fixes rendering problems the point cloud (now all styles are
  working)
  - Ogre should be updated to their next release when available. We use
  the current master only because of the upcoming ros2 release.
  * Make Ogre window work on MacOSX
  This also fixes the detached 3D window problem on Mac.
* Refactor PointCloud display plugin (`#121 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/121>`_)
  * Initial cleaning of PointCloud
  - remove unused variable
  - refactor to c++14 standard
  - cleanup small problems
  * Fix BoundingRadius, now returns a radius
  * Extract methods and minor refactoring
  - Extract methods from  popPoints()
  - Minor refactoring of addPoints
  - Remove ogre_version flags
  -- The visitor function requires Ogre 1.6 or above
  -- We require 1.10, so this flag should be unnecessary now
  - Combine parameters width, height, size to dimension vector
  - Extract switch case to get material
  * Patch ogre to show point clouds, reenable point types
  * Add tests to PointCloud
  - Adapt public API to expose renderables
  - Adds a testing environment using our render system
  - Logging is kept to a minimum but can be switched on if necessary
  - First use case of ogre testing environment
  - Adds tests to completely test PointCloud excluding PointCloudRenderable
  - Tests make use of exposed renderables\_ vector
  * Delete comment in material
  - the material is explicitly in the scripts150 folder
  - geometry shaders are available at glsl>150 so it seems correct
  - hence the comment is wrong and misleading
  * Use deque instead of vector of renderables
  - there is need to remove from the front
  - there is no need to have renderables contiguous in memory
  * Extract PointCloudRenderable from PointCloud
  * Add tests to PointCloudRenderable
  * Refactoring of addPoints
  - extract smaller methods
  Introduce struct to have much cleaner interfaces
  Reorder functions
  * Change interface of addPoints
  - the only known usage uses vectors
  - vectors are safer to work with anyway, while we can still use memcpy
  * Set correct rendering operation upon renderable creation
  * Refactor PointCloudRenderable
  * Harmonize comments and public interface of PointCloud
  * Extract PointCloudSelectionHandler from PointCloudCommon
  * Add helper function to create a PointCloud2 from points
  Add PointCloud to message_creators + convenience methods
  * New tests and refactoring of PointCloud2Display
  Use std::vector interface instead of raw pointers
  * Extract PointCloudConversion
  * Extract point cloud transformers into separate files
  * Add Tiles, which was missing from options
  * Refactor point cloud conversion function
  - also change interface to return the new PointCloud2
  * Refactor interfaces to not use references to shared pointers
  - using pass by value instead, C++11 move semantics will avoid
  unnecessary copies
  - Remove also meaningless const qualifiers in function declarations
  - Replace virtual with override
  * Refactoring of PointCloudCommon
  - minor refactorings to C++14 standard
  - add display functionality to transform incoming PointCloud to correct frame again
  - refactor addMessage functionality
  * Add tests to transformers
  * Refactor transformers
  * Reenable showing number of points
  * Subscribe using topic name from topic property
* Migrate PointCloud display (`#111 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/111>`_)
  * Move point cloud display files to rviz_common
  * Move display and display_context to include folder
  * Move frame_manager to include folder
  * Move message filter display to rviz_common
  * Move properties to include folder
  * Move point_cloud to rviz_rendering
  * Fix up point_cloud in rviz_rendering
  * Move validate_floats to rviz_common
  * Comment out parts dependending on message filters
  * Move selection headers to include folder
  * Migrate point cloud display, compiles successfully
  * Move ogre materials to rviz_rendering
  * Enable point cloud shaders
  * Show a static point cloud in display
  The static cloud is created in the onInitialize() method of the point_cloud_display
  Only RenderMode::RM_POINTS works, probably because of the shaders
  * Enable listening to PointCloud
  - currently, this is done by
  -- exposing the node in display.hpp
  -- spinning the node in display_group
  * Uncrustify over rviz_default_plugins
  * Uncrustify rviz_common files
  * Suppress cppcheck memory leak warning
  - the potentially leaked properties are added to other properties
  * Cpplint fix in rviz_default_plugins
  * Cpplint fix in rviz_common
  * Uncrustify and cpplint fix rviz_rendering
  * Make test resilient against changes in Qt rounding behavior
  - For different versions of Qt5 the behavior regarding handling of
  doubles and floats has changed, see https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-47192?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Aall-tabpanel
  - Using numbers with an exaxt floating point representation as we do
  not specifiy the exact version of Qt we depend on.
  * Fix point cloud garbage collection on Windows
  Incrementing the end pointer of a list crashes on Windows, but works fine on Linux.
  * Add review comments (mostly add TODOs)
  * fix include
  * remove other depend on rcl (covered by rclcpp)
  * fix include
* Feature/rviz media export (`#66 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/66>`_)
  * Implement replacement for rviz' media_export
  - resources can be an arbitrary number of shallow folders
  - should be registered as rviz_ogre_media_exports resource in ament_index
  - a warning is thrown if a non-existant folder is added as a resource location
  * Introduce a macro to simplify adding resources
  - macro takes an arbitrary number of paths to folders
  - checks if folders exists
  - registers all resources in ament_index
  - installs all folders
  * Extract function to unit test and add tests
  * Change CMake macro
  - macro now only saves to variable and can be added
  an arbitrary number of times
  - the true installation is done with ament_package()
  - furthermore, we correctly deploy the macro
  * Implement review comments
  Fix StringHelper as its own class
  - Will never get instantiated
  - Now only provides a method to the rviz_rendering namespace
  Fix include order
  * Add example plugin to test register_ogre_media_exports
  - the plugin could be expanded to a true rviz_plugin
  - this can be used as an example for plugin developers
  * Make CMake output more meaningful by adding full path
  * Adjust CMake style to correct style
  * Adjust style in test plugin
  * Adjust code formatting
  * Remove anonymous namespaces around tests
  - Unnecessary
  - Multiple Tests inside one namespace fail cppcheck >=1.79
* Fix dependencies on Windows (`#71 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/71>`_)
  * Adjust CMakeLists to handle dependencies on Windows
  * Fix problem with mouse events on Windows
  Without this line Qt is not detecting any mouse events while the mouse is above the render window.
  * Add TODO to assimp import fix; only set externalWindowHandle when on Windows
* Cleanup unnecessary cmake variable OGRE_PLUGIN_DIR (`#76 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/76>`_)
* Linting/fix rviz rendering followup (`#70 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/70>`_)
  * Remove NOLINT comments
  - replace using namespace statements
  * Improve expressiveness of NOLINT comment
  * Remove ./ from header includes
  - As a NOLINT is necessary for these includes anyway there is no need
  for the ./ as path (introduced in pr `#67 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/67>`_)
  - The NOLINT can be removed once the corresponding headers are renamed
  to a .hpp.
  * Restore include order
  - disable cpplint where necessary
  * Rename all headers to hpp file ending
  A current cppcheck (windows) parses .h files as c files instead of c++ files
  * Adapt code to moving of header files
  * Switch to " style includes for ros headers
  - This avoids cpplint include order errors
  - Also fixing few include order issues
  * Restore double spaces for line comments
  - In case of NOLINT comments the linter does not pick up on the wrong style.
* Resize render window in expose event to correctly scale the content (`#74 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/74>`_)
* Hide dummy window on Windows (`#69 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/69>`_)
* Linting/fix rviz rendering (`#67 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/67>`_)
  * Fix remaining linting issues in rviz_rendering
  * Fix some linting errors in rviz_common
  - ament_uncrustify errors
  - whitespace errors, include order errors
  - easy missing includes
  - TODO(anyone) instead of TODO
  * Fix cast errors in rviz_common
  * NOLINT comment for .h header includes
  cpplint neither wants include "header.h" nor
  include "./header.h" for different reasons.
  Disable as in TEMP folder
  * Mark constructors as explicit when callable with one argument
  * Disable Linter
  - disable for unimportant errors in temp folder
  - disable for false positive includes
  - disable for namespace usage
* Fixup rviz2_app (`#60 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/60>`_)
  * re-remove the AMENT_IGNORE for the rviz2 package
  * migrate the ogre_media/models
* [rviz_rendering] update ogre version + fix deprecated function (`#31 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/31>`_)
  * update ogre version + fix deprecated function
  * Adopt patch from 1.7 to new ogre version 1.8
  * readd one of the patches to fix white space
  * fix deprecation warnings
* setup minimal viable rviz2 application (`#20 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/20>`_)
  * migrate files from old rviz or move to public include
  * implement MVP application and ROSCon demo
* Get ogre_media folder from rviz install location
  - move ogre_media folder in installation step in CMake
  - set resource directory before building the rendering system
  - get the path to set the directory from ament_index
* Scale rendering window correctly on Windows (`#23 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/23>`_)
* fixes resize when using maximize (`#13 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/13>`_)
* Fix cpplint errors
* Modify sphere material to show light reflections
* Reformat grid using uncrustify
* Add grid to scene, reposition camera
* Move grid to rviz_rendering
* update files in rviz_rendering to pass tests
* add cmake lines for added rviz_rendering files
* move (only) all of the files needed by the VisualizerApp
  I calculated this list by doing a depth first crawl of the include
  statements in both the headers and c++ files. I moved the headers to
  either rviz_rendering (defaulting to public headers) or rviz_common
  (defaulting to private headers) and changed the extensions to hpp. I
  also moved the cpp files to the respective package. I also added a line
  in the CMakeLists.txt for all the source files and also the headers if I
  determined that they would need Qt's automoc at a glance. I added those
  entried commented out so they could be turned on a few at a time when we
  start fixing up the code. Aside from changing the extensions on the
  header files, the content of the files is untouched.
* Linting for rviz_rendering (`#17 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/17>`_)
  * Introduce linters in rviz_rendering
  - we don't use ament_lint_common because copyright checks fail
  - we want to wait for changes in ament_copyright before fixing
  * Fix cppcheck errors
  - only one error: memory leak of log_manager
  * Extract SdkQtCameraMan from OgreBites to fix linters
  - SdkQtCameraMan is from OgreBites and not from rviz
  - No change in functionality
  * adding a todo about the copyright linter
  * add a comment about delete-less new call
* pass the pixel ratio to Ogre from Qt (`#16 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/16>`_)
  this is needed to support retina displays and some
  other high resolution displays
* remove demo files and other unused files
* cleanup debugging statements
* first pass of uncrustify and cpplint
* update ogre window settings (`#9 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/9>`_)
  this fixes the black render window issue
* Merge pull request `#10 <https://github.com/ros2/rviz/issues/10>`_ from ros2/fix_resizing
  fixup rendering example and resizing
* fixup rendering example and resizing
* cleanup cmake
* style
* use new logic to build against ogre
* got it building and running on Windows, render window is still messed up
* wit, still segfaulting on Linux
* wip
* more ros2 setup
* move plugins.cfg
* move render_widget.cpp/hpp
* move ogre_logging.cpp/hpp
* move render_system.cpp/hpp
